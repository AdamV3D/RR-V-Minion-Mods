This design is a remix
Original creation here: https://www.printables.com/model/166872-30_series_reverse_bowden_m8_threads

This modified Z top changes a few things about the Ratrig design.
- Lead screw arm remove (it didn't seem to do anything anyway)
- stops added to help prevent carraige coming off of rail
- Added filament feed tube that suits both my spool holder designs
- Uses the top of the Phaetus dragonfly hotend that gets removed for assembly to hold the feed tube
